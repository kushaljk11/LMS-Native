// Use expo-router's entry so routes and layouts are mounted correctly.
// Keep the import only; do not register a separate root component when using expo-router.
import 'expo-router/entry';

// If you need to keep a custom App component for other reasons, do not call
// registerRootComponent here. Instead, compose or use it inside route screens or layouts.
